# GravitySim
A fun project I did to help teach myself Python. Configure bodies with mass, position, and initial velocities and visualize how they interact, including merging if two get close enough!

## Run
`python main.py`

## Modifying Simulation
All of the code that determines the simulation parameters lives in `main.py`. Try changing the values of the following variables in main.py to change the simulation:
* `bodies`
* `step_size`
* `num_steps`
* `max_combination_distance`
